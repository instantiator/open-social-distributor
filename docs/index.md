# Open Social Distributor documentation

**UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

[![CLI - build, test, release](https://github.com/instantiator/open-social-distributor/actions/workflows/CLI-build-test-release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/instantiator/open-social-distributor/actions/workflows/CLI-build-test-release.yml)

This is a tool for managing social posts across multiple platforms. Simple to configure, and able to run as a command line client, or as a service in a Docker container or an AWS CloudFormation stack.

**At current time,** you can build, configure, and use the CLI to post a messages, threads, and images to a variety of social networks.

**Coming soon:**

* A containerised service to make regular posts
* An AWS stack (to do the same)

## Download binaries

See: [Releases](https://github.com/instantiator/open-social-distributor/releases)

## Configuration

To add networks to your configuration, you'll need to obtain authorisation tokens with permission to post. See:

* [Configuration](configuration.md)
* [Connection strings](connection-strings.md)
* [Authorisation tokens](auth-tokens.md)

## Making posts

You can use the command-line interface (CLI) to make an ad-hoc post to any number of social networks.

* [CLI options](cli-options.md)
* [Post List format](post-list-format.md)
* [Post composition](post-composition.md)

## Developer notes

### Current state of development

### Social networks supported

This project is in development. Additional capabilities are coming soon.

| Network | Test | Post | Thread | Link | Tags | Images |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Console | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🆗 |

✅ = implemented, working
⌛️ = implemented, not fully tested yet

**NB.** Twitter is not a safe place to build your brand or identity, and has not been included in this list.

#### NB

* Console image support is purely to confirm that the image exists.
* The Facebook API does not support posting to a _user_ feed.

### Config support

Support scripts are found at the root of the `open-social-distributor-app` directory. The CLI supports configuration tests. Scripts are provided as a shortcut to build and invoke the CLI:

| Script | Purpose |
|-|-|
| `test-connections.sh` | Builds and invokes the CLI to test the connections defined in a configuration file |

### Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-|-|
| `DistributionCLI` | A CLI for basic configuration and message posting |
| `DistributionFunction` | A scheduled posting function, run as an AWS CloudWatch application stack |
| `DistributionService` | A scheduled posting service, runs as a Docker container |
| `DistributorLib` | Shared code with functionality to support the above 3 use cases |

### Build and deploy scripts

Build and deploy scripts are found at the root of the `open-social-distributor-app` directory.

| Script | Purpose |
|-|-|
| `export-aws-defaults.sh` | Exports some default AWS environment variables. |
| `aws-sync-stack.sh` | Builds and synchronises the project code with an AWS CloudFormation stack |
| `aws-deploy-stack.sh` | **UNDER DEVELOPMENT** |

| Script | Purpose |
|-|-|
| `build-all.sh` | Builds dev versions of the CLI, lambda function, and service projects as .NET binaries |
| `release-cli.sh` | Builds release binaries of the CLI for Windows, OS X, and Linux |

| Script | Purpose |
|-|-|
| `docker-run-service.sh` | Builds, tests, and runs the service for the `int` or `prod` environment |

### Unit tests

Testing scripts are found at the root of the `open-social-distributor-app` directory.

| Script | Purpose |
|-|-|
| `run-unit-tests.sh` | builds and runs all or some of the unit tests |

### Integration tests

Integration tests check that the distributor can connect to and post to the various social media networks.

Support for all social networks is limited - some have fewer constraints than others to create test accounts for.

| Script | Purpose |
|-|-|
| `run-integration-tests.sh` | builds and runs the social network integration tests |
